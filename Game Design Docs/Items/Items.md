yeah nah i dont really give a shit about any of this shit tbh i'm just a guy.
a lot of this was written by ai but i corrected it because i wanted to game myself because i know i'm the type of person who falls to that one talking point about how if you want to ask a question and have it answered quickly and correctly then what youre supposed to do is you ask the question and then make an alt account and answer it wrongly so that some autistic nerd (me) does the "erm ackshually" thing and corrects the incorrect answer.

# Items

Catalogue of the implemented ability items (and class weapons), mirroring the seeds in `server/spacetimedb/src/item/seeds.rs`. The ability design pitches these realize live in `Items/Abilities/Abilities.md`.

**How to read the gates:** classes emerge from gear locked behind stat thresholds (doc 03). Base stats are 10 for everyone, so gates are set just above base — primary 15, secondary 12 — as placeholder values pending tuning. Stat shorthand: STR = strength, WIS = wisdom, DEX = dexterity, DPS = damage-dealer, SUP = supporter.

**Shared rules:** abilities are not consumed on use — they go on cooldown (all items below have unlimited charges). The first ability slot is stronger: effect magnitudes scale by slot position (×1.5 / 1.25 / 1.1 / 1.0 / 0.9 / 0.8). Ability targets clamp to 600 range. One active mark (bleed or store) per player — recasting a mark replaces it (bleed pools dump instantly, store pools forfeit). Status effects purge on death, leaving the world, and disconnect. Hold-to-charge items self-slow (50%) and suppress firing while held; max charge 3s, then auto-release; charge scales the effect ×(0.25 + 0.75 × fraction).

# DPS

## Bullet master (DEX 15, DPS 12)

Weapons (toggle shot patterns with T):

| Item | Patterns |
|---|---|
| Marksman Bow | Piercing longshot (45 dmg, pierces) / point-blank spread (3×12) / quick light shot (20 dmg, fast cadence) |
| Warbow | Heavy single shot (60 dmg) / five-arrow fan (innate `scatter_fan` toggle, can't be removed) |

Abilities:

| Item | Effect | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|
| Charged Shot | Hold-to-charge, release fires a 600×20 piercing shot for up to 70 damage. Scales with DEX | 12s |
| Volley | 350-long cone (0.6 rad spread): 6 pellets of 10 damage each — flat armour eats every pellet, so it's strong vs low-defence enemies. Scales with DEX | 10s |
| Quick Slash | Erases enemy bullets dealing ≤15 damage in a 140×60 rectangle in front of you | 4s |
| Grapple Hook | Pull yourself toward the cursor, up to 450 (you still take damage mid-pull) | 10s |

## Warrior (STR 15, DPS 12)

Bleed marks — mark an enemy (cursor-pick, 100px pick radius); 70% of each hit *from that enemy* becomes a pool that drains over ~5s, 30% lands instantly. One item per purge condition:

| Item | Sheds by | Duration | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sanguine Brand | Taking no damage for 2s | 10s | 15s |
| Blood Oath | Staying within 200 of the mark for 5s | 15s | 15s |
| Crimson Tithe | Damaging the mark | 15s | 15s |
| Deathmark | The mark dying | 20s | 15s |
| Bloodbath | The mark dying — also converts *your* hits on the mark into a bleed on it (a third of the hit per second for 3s) instead of instant damage | 20s | 20s |

Store-damage marks — your damage to the mark is withheld for 8s, then released at 2×/1×/0× per the wager (marked-enemy death forfeits the pool):

| Item | Wager | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|
| Gambler's Mark | 0 hits taken = 2×, 1–4 hits = 1×, 5+ = 0× (witness-corroborated) | 20s |
| Duelist's Wager | Never stray 150 from the mark = 2×, stay within 300 = 1×, ever leave 300 = 0× | 20s |
| Blood Price | Store ≥500 = 2×, ≥200 = 1×, below = 0× | 20s |

Movement:

| Item | Effect | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|
| Warpath | Hold-to-charge, release blinks toward the cursor — up to 400 at full charge | 12s |

## Wizard (WIS 15, DPS 12)

All spells scale with WIS (`damage × (1 + wis × 0.002)`):

| Item | Effect | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|
| Arc Beam | 500×40 beam, 30 damage | 8s |
| Converge | 40 damage within 120 of the cursor (converging visual) | 12s |
| Fireball | Hold-to-charge, release hurls a fireball: up to 50 damage within 100 of the cursor | 10s |
| Arcane Spire | Spire at the cursor for 8s: enemies within 120 burn for 8 damage/s | 15s |
| Meteor | 80 damage within 200 of the cursor (shrapnel visual) | 20s |
| Arc Laser | 800×15 laser, 45 damage | 15s |

# SUP

## Paladin (WIS 15, SUP 12 — open question: the design doc has no Paladin header; currently mirrors Witch Doctor)

The warrior's bleed and store marks as AoE auras (allies within 150, same mechanics):

| Item | Effect | Duration | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consecrated Brand | AoE bleed mark; sheds after 2s without taking a hit | 10s | 20s |
| Martyr's Oath | AoE bleed mark; sheds after staying near the mark 5s | 15s | 20s |

| Smite | Store the damage you take (pre-mitigation), then unleash it within 150 around you — recast to release early at the cursor | 8s | 25s |

## Tank (STR 15, SUP 12)

| Item | Effect | Duration | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shield Bash | Enemies within 120 take weapon damage + 34 stagger; a full stagger bar (100) stuns for 2s, then resets. Stun behavior is per-enemy (pause / slowed / enraged). An armed Retribution store rides the hit | — | 6s |
| Sundering Bash | As Shield Bash, and the stun also breaks armour (defence 0) | — | 10s |
| Bulwark | Self: invulnerable | 2s | 25s |
| Iron Stance | Self: 50% reduced damage taken | 8s | 20s |

| Shield Wall | 200×80 wall in front of you that erases any enemy bullet crossing it | 4s | 12s |

## Trickster (WIS 15, DEX 12, SUP 12 — the doc's `wis > dex > 0` ordering is approximated as flat minimums)

| Frost Sigil | Curse: slowed 40% | 4s | 8s |

# Deferred / not implemented

- Archer shootable dummy, trickster decoy, trickster invisibility — all need enemy retargeting onto non-player entities (future batch).
